# Futbol

Starter repository for the [Turing School](https://turing.io/) Futbol project.

This project is a collaboration between Arnaldo Aparicio, Kerri Hoffmann, Wade Naughton, and Mallory Vining.

Our goal as group was to create a program with working methods and a robust testing suite that analyzed CSV data.

Our takeaways are to:
  1. Plan ahead more thoroughly
  2. Gain a better grasp of Ruby design principles
  3. Get more comfortable with mocks and stubs
  4. Have better git/Github working practices
